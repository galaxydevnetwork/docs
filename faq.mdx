    <Accordion title="Does GalaxyDevNetwork get Updates?">
        GalaxyDevNetwork does receive some updates but for its GDN Subprojects like GDN Discord Server or GDN Docs. GalaxyDevNetwork is a Multiverse and only Multiverse so it does not receive any updates for GalaxyDevNetwork as like the Multiverse.

    <Accordion title="Why does GalaxyDevNetwork (Multiverse) don't have any pages?">
        Because GalaxyDevNetwork is a Multiverse so it doesn't need help but there are other GalaxyDevNetwork Pages.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Why does GalaxyDevNetwork Docs exist?">
        Because GalaxyDevNetwork Docs acts like an important part of GalaxyDevNetwork that could maybe always be there for extra support/help for you.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="GalaxyDevNetwork sometimes doesn't update any projects for a long time?">
        GalaxyDevNetwork can't update every single time as fast as possible but here are some notes: If an update takes a short time to finish and announce that means it's small,
        if it takes a little bit of time to announce it could mean it's a little bit better, but if it takes a very long time, it could mean the update is very good.
