meme20200 has some beautiful features that make it unique from other Minehut Servers like:
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Java Over Skript" defaultOpen={true}>
        We replace Skript with Java because we think Skript can't handle the meme20200 style.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Dupe" defaultOpen={true}>
        The Main part of meme20200 is the Dupe, it is the core part of meme20200 and it allows people to build whatever they want.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Minecraft 2 Website Sync" defaultOpen={true}>
        meme20200 Teams is a Minecraft2Website and I think the only one with a custom website powered using JavaScript, Node.js. 
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Minecraft to Discord (vice-versa)" defaultOpen={true}>
        Directly communicate with people in Discord and vice versa for Discord.

GalaxyDev has some very cool bot features that make it useful and appealing to GalaxyDevNetwork Discord Users like:
<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Slash Commands" defaultOpen={true}>
        Enough of the `g?` and let's unite into one command prefix which is `/` that every bot is using.
    </Accordion>
    <Accordion title="Apply For Staff (meme20200 x GalaxyDev)" defaultOpen={true}>
        Apply for staff is a **GalaxyDevNetwork** exclusive command which is to apply for staff on **meme20200** & **GalaxyDevNetwork** on **GalaxyDevNetwork**
    </Accordion>
